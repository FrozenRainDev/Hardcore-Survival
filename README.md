## Profile

The hardcore survival mod is an **unprecedented**, difficulty-increasing, survival-oriented mod in the MC modding history. It delivers an incredibly realistic and challenging survival experience with more sophisticated gameplay transformation.

It is a combination of

- Transformation of gameplay
  - Elements inspired by mods like MITE, BTW, and TFC
  - Mechanics borrowed from hardcore survival games: Don't Starve, Project Zomboid, CDDA, and more
- Survival elements: thirst, temperature, medicine, stamina, sanity, nutrition, etc.
- Personal inspirations: stone tools, boss challenges, and rogue-like/adventure elements

"Not to be missed for difficulty lovers, hardcore players and survival enthusiasts!"

> **DISCLAIMER:**
>
> 1. The mod is currently **UNFINISHED**, but it has reached a fully **playable** level. Please understand that it requires further enrichment and polishing.
> 2. People with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, epilepsy, and other conditions that make them unsuitable for intense gaming experiences should NOT play, otherwise the consequences will be at their own risk!



## Survival Mechanisms Overhaul

### Health & First Aid <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5AcX4.png" width="32px" />

- The recovery is quite slow and requires specific items to expedite it.
- Your initial max health is 12 points (6 hearts), and it can be increased by leveling up.
- Each death reduces maximum health by 10% (up to -70%), which can be restored using a golden apple or selaginella.
- Debuffs caused by being damaged: *Injury, Pain, Bleeding, Fracture*

### Thirst <img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/18/piiP92D.png" width="32px" />

- Players cannot live without drinking water.
- Drinking raw water can lead to *diarrhea* and *parasite infections*, so it's advisable to boil it.

### Temperature <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5A2nJ.png" width="32px" />

- Temperature is affected by the environment and players should be within the suitable temperature range.
- To cope with extreme temperatures, wear specific clothing or drink thermostatic potions.

### Stamina <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5AvNt.png" width="32px" />

- Activities like sprinting, attacking, and mining deplete stamina rapidly.
- Lack of stamina affects movement speed and combat abilities.
- With the strength effect, stamina will always be full.

### Sanity <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5A7cD.png" width="32px" />

- It can be interpreted as mental health.
- Exposure to darkness, combat with monsters, diseases, and unpalatable food can lower sanity.
- It can be restored by holding flowers, sleeping, or consuming enjoyable food.
- Low sanity leads to horrible hallucinations.

### Nutrition <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5AhA1.png" width="32px" />

Players must maintain a balanced diet, as excessive meat consumption can result in malnutrition, leading to slower health recovery and increased hunger rates.

### Food Spoilage

- Food can now spoil, with different types having various expiration dates.
- Spoilage progresses through four stages: fresh, stale, spoiled, and rotten (which often turns into rot).
- Using an icebox or making jerky can extend food shelf life.

### Wetness <img src="https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/19/piiE2KU.png" width="36px" />

- The direct UI value display has been removed in the current version, replaced by a damp debuff.
- When players soaking in water or being rained on, the wetness will increase rapidly.
- Becoming wet causes players to catch cold easily and lower player's body temperature.
- Being near a heat source (e.g., fire, lava) helps with drying.

### Mood

- Panic
  - Witnessing monsters or being in dark environments increases panic.
  - Panic reduces the player's attack accuracy (i.e. probability of attacking failure) ,  and a minimum of 5% and maximum of 15% attack weakening.
  - As one's level increases, players become less likely to get panicked.
  - The panic effect can be temporarily removed with fearlessness herb.
- Hapiness
  - Happiness is inversely related to sanity.
  - Low sanity leads to decreased happiness, resulting in reduced healing and mining speeds.



## Gameplay Transformation

> The transformation is similar to MITE (Minecraft is Too Easy)

### Mining restrictions

- Most blocks, even dirt and gravel, cannot be destroyed with bare hands, necessitating tools for digging. Otherwise you will get hurt and find breaking them is nearly as impossible as bedrock!
- Only flowers, grass, sand, leaves and wool and so on can be destroyed directly.
- The majority of original wood and stone tool crafting has been abolished, while tools made of stone and flint have been added.

### Stone Age <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5AY6g.png" width="32px" />

- At the start of the game, you'll need to break a lot of grass to obtain resources like grass fibers, sticks, and stones. These resources are essential for crafting stone tools:
  - Processing raw materials for stone tools: Use grass fibers to craft fiber strings; Hit rock against hard blocks to get sharp stone blocks.
  - Crafting basic stone weapons: By using Fiber strings, sharp stones, and sticks, you can craft stone cones (digging tools for dirt and gravels, etc.), stone knives, and stone spears.

- You can also create a campfire by drilling with a fire bow, tinder, firewood, and sticks.

### Flint & Wood Age <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5A1tP.png" width="32px" />

- To obtain flint, you can dig gravel using a stone cone. Afterward, you can hit the flint against a hard block to get sharp flint. Sharp flints can be used to craft various flint tools.
- Players can craft a flint hatchet (no stone hatchet) to cut down trees.
- The logs from cutting trees can be used to make wooden shovels, (spiked) clubs, improvised shields, and wooden armors.

### Copper Age <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5E8ER.png" width="32px" />

- You can obtain raw copper powder by digging gravel. Combining 9 pieces of raw copper powder allows you to craft raw copper.
- Baking clay on a campfire yields bricks, which can be used to craft a furnace for burning raw copper into copper ingots.<!--- ~~(not yet implemented) To make tools you have to learn metal crafting blueprints in order to unlock them (from chests in mob spawning cage, abandoned minecart)~~-->
- Once you've gathered enough copper ingots to make a copper pickaxe, it's time to mine! Congratulations, the pre-existing ordeal is over, and the game ushers in a new chapter!<!--### ~~Entering the Nether (not yet implemented)~~ <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/08/31/v5AJ1S.png" width="32px" />- ~~Defeat the Boss Giant Trilobite that prevents the player from teleporting to the Nether.~~- ~~After the Giant Trilobite is defeated for the first time, the monsters in the Overworld will be strengthened.~~-->



## Other things interesting

- Villages will only spawn under following conditions: 1. The world has existed for more than 32 days; 2. The player has obtained a copper pickaxe. NOTE: All the villages will be zombie villages. (However, zombie villagers do not burn under sunlight)
- If you tried to open a chest which is not placed by yourself, then you need a pickaxe to pry it open. Besides, chests containing items can't be broken or blown up.
- Players now have a limited reach distance. By holding tools, you can extend your reach. This means you can no longer rely on having a longer reach than monsters to attack them.
- Players can be engulfed by total darkness (similar to Don't Starve) when they find themselves in confined, opaque, pitch-dark spaces (excluding moonlight).
- Entities modification:
  - Animals now exhibit improved escaping abilities.
  - Zombies have enhanced target-searching abilities and can attempt to break blocks and attack animals.
  - Spiders can spit out silk to trap you, and even common spider attacks can be poisonous.
  - Skeletons are more fragile with only 4 hearts.
- Considerably slower crop growth. Bone meals nerfed.
- Players will experience oxygen deficiency in the depths of caves, but this can be mitigated by placing leaves, consuming water breathing potions, or wearing helmets enchanted with respiration (underwater breathing).
- New food items.
- There are still many more details waiting for you to explore.
